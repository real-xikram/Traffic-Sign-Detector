# Traffic-Sign-Detector
Image Classification of traffic signs using CNNs

# Key highlights:
* GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark used for training.
    **Features of the dataset
      -Single-image, multi-class classification problem
      -More than 40 classes
      -More than 50,000 images in total
      -Large, lifelike database
* Developed an end-to-end CNN model for image classification of 43 Traffic Signs using one-hot encoding for autonomous driving cars
* Data Augmentation is used for geometric and color space transformation on training data to simulate changes in weather
* The model is complied using the Adam Optimizer achieving 98.69 % cross validation accuracy 
* GUI application is built in test.py for testing png images with the same distribution as training dataset
